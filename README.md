Repository for sharing scripts which we use often and can help others to automate their lifes. 

## Add new
If You want to add new script put it to specific folder (or create one) like PowerShell, WindowsBash, LinuxShell etc.. Every script should has contain header comment whit basic explenation.
Every folder should has Readme.md file where are scripts described (we do not want to open every file to find exact script).
